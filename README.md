Hi everyone,

This repository contains all the scripts accompanying the following manuscript: The Indoor And Outdoor Exposome In The Preconception And Pregnancy Periods And Its Impact On Birth Outcomes: A Dutch Nationwide Population-Based Study. Link to preregistration: https://osf.io/nsx7a/overview. 

The 'prep' files contain all the data cleaning files, the 'merge' files contain the merging data files, and the 'stat' files contain the analyses files. 

Of note, this is work currently in progress! 

Best,
Anna
